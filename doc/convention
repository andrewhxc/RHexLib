Header files:

  To avoid redefining things, header files are surrounded by

    #ifndef _NAME_H
    #define _NAME_H

    ..code..

    #endif

Data types:

  All new data types are in capital letters: BOOL, MODULE_FUNCTION, etc.
  A data type specific to an object class is prefixed by that class's 
  name.

Enums:

  Elements of an enum are upper case, prefixed by the object class that
  uses them (if any).

Local variables and struct elements:

  Lower case:

Functions:

  Initial capitals as in: MMAddModule, MMMainLoop. If the function is global,
  it should have a prefix describing its main object class.
