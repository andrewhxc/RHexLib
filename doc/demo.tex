\chapter{Standard RHex Demo Program: rhex\_standard}
\label{sec:demo_executable}

RHexLib distribution includes a demo executable which incorporates all the
features of the library and all the capabilities of the robot in a single
user interface. The main component in its operation is the {\rm Supervisor}, 
which is a state machine controlling the activation, deactivation and
configuration of different controllers based on user commands. The state
machine implementation also allows autonomous decisions using all the data
available to the system.
