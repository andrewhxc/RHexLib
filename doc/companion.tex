\section{Overview}

Describe the document and how to use it with the user's manual.

\section{Modules and the Module Manager}

{\it Modules} are the fundamental components of any \rhexlib program. They essentially define
processes or threads that are managed by an object called the {\it Module Manager}. For example,
there are modules for keeping track of the motor positions, for PD control of the motors, for
filtering sensor readings, for high level continuous controllers and for discrete event supervisory
controllers. 

The various types of modules, some of which are provided by \rhexlib and some of which the
programmer must define, are all inheirited from the base class \Module. This base class has five
virtual methods that must be defined by any child class: these are \initFN, \activateFN,
\deactivateFN, \uninitFN, and \updateFN. The Module Mangager calls these methodss using the
following scheme. At first, a module's status is {\it uninitialized}. When the module is added to
the Module Mangager, using the function {\tt MMAddModule}, the \initFN method is called and the
module is added to the Module Manager's list and its status set to {\it inactive}. The \initFN
method is thus the place to initialize any local data needed by the modele. Then, at some point, the
module will be activated, using the either the {\tt ActivateModule} function or the {\tt GrabModule}
function, at which point the \activateFN method is called and the module's status becomes {\it
active}. Once active, the module's \updateFN method is repeatedly called by the Module Manager, at a
freqency specified by {\it period} opf the module. When the module is inactivated, by {\tt
MMDeactivateModule} or {\tt MMReleaseModule}, the \deactivateFN method is called and updates no
cease. The module may also be removed, using {\tt MMRemoveModule}, calling the \uninitFN method and
removing it from the Module Manager's list. This ``life cycle'' of a module is shown in Figure
\ref{fig-life-cycle}. An example of how to define a module is shown in the next subsection.

Also: other things the module manager does for you (clocks, etc)

\subsection{Defining New Modules}

An example of how to define a module. (the safty module perhaps?)

\section{RHex Specific Modules}

This has a general description of the modules and the heirarchy picture.

\subsection{Hardware Issues}

Maybe here is where to describe the preferred way of handling encoders and motor drives, etc.

\section{State Machines}

What is a state machine and what is its lifetime?

\subsection{Defining New State Machines}

An example.
